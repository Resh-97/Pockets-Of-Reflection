  description_less: This project proposes three novel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid networks for multi-task learning of learner mental state recognition from facial expressions in the wild. 
  description_more: >
    <p>The contribution of this work is three-fold:
    <br> 1. A Proof-of-Concept(POC) for multi-task video classification of student mental States. The proposed approach predicts the level (very low, low, high and very high) of four student mental states - Engagement, Confusion, Boredom, Frustration.
    <br> 2. Spatio-Temporal analysis of facial features for student affect recognition by combining deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) based feature extractors and sequence learning via LSTMs.
    <br> 3. A study on the performance of three SOTA networks as a feature extractor for online learning problems. The three networks are:
    <br> * Feature Extractor 1: Inspired by a teacher network proposed by [Schoneveld et al. (2021)] trained on Google FEC dataset and AffectNet dataset.
    <br> * Feature Extractor 2: ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset.
    <br> * Feature Extractor 3: Inception-ResNet-V1 pre-trained on VGGFace2.</p>

    <p>This project analyses and describes the attempt to reproduce the paper, MixSeq. It was our team submission to the COMP6248 Reproducibility Challenge 2022.
    <br>
    Under the assumption that macroscopic time series follow a mixture distribution, the authors hypothesise that lower variance of constituting latent mixture components could improve the estimation of macroscopic time series. We learned the challenges of reimplementing the proposed model, and as a result, we developed our own implementation based on this conjecture to prove its validity.</p>

  description_less: Multi-class Logistic Regression Classifier with Spatial Pyramid Matching for Feature Extraction
  description_more: >
    <p> 
    Most approaches can be separated into two distinct sub-classes of problems, feature extraction from images and multiclass classification in a high dimensional feature space. This project provides an empirical analysis of three approaches to this problem.
    <br> First, the performance of a k-Nearest Neighbour classifier using features derived from a low-resolution image representation (’tiny image’) is evaluated. The performance of this classifier can be superseded by an ensemble of 15 one-vs-all classifiers trained on a visual bag of words lexicon derived from raw image pixels.
    <br> Finally, a multi-class logistic regression classifier coupled with features extracted by spatial pyramid matching outperforms each of the aforementioned methods.</p>
