  description_less: This paper proposes three novel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid networks for multi-task learning of learner mental state
recognition from facial expressions in the wild.

    <p>The contribution of this work is three-fold:
    1. A Proof-of-Concept(POC) for multi-task video classification of student mental States. The proposed approach predicts the level (very low, low, high and very high) of four student mental states - Engagement, Confusion, Boredom, Frustration.
    2. Spatio-Temporal analysis of facial features for student affect recognition by combining deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) based feature extractors and sequence learning via LSTMs.
    3. A study on the performance of three SOTA networks as a feature extractor for online learning problems. The three networks are:
    * Feature Extractor 1: Inspired by a teacher network proposed by [Schoneveld et al. (2021)] trained on Google FEC dataset and AffectNet dataset.
    * Feature Extractor 2: ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset.
    * Feature Extractor 3: Inception-ResNet-V1 pre-trained on VGGFace2.</p>
